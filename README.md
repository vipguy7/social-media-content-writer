Social Media Content Writer App
Project Overview
The Social Media Content Writer app is designed to streamline and supercharge the process of creating engaging, platform-specific content for social media. By leveraging advanced AI (Google Gemini AI, OpenAI APIs) and modern frontend frameworks, the app enables users to generate, refine, and deploy posts efficiently.

1. Creation Strategy: From Idea to Working App
  a. Starting with One Core Idea
      Objective: Help users generate high-quality, relevant, and consistent social media posts with minimal effort.
      Initial Logic: Begin by identifying common pain points—writer’s block, platform-specific requirements, and time constraints.
  b. Defining the Generating Logic
      Content Input: Users provide a topic, keywords, or a brief description.
      Processing Pipeline:
      Prompt Engineering: Structure user input into an optimized prompt for AI text generation.
      AI Text Generation: Use Google Gemini AI or OpenAI APIs to generate draft content.
      Platform Adaptation: Format output according to target platform (Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, etc.), respecting character limits and tone.
      UI Feedback Loop: Display generated content, allowing users to edit, regenerate, or approve.
      Iteration: Enable users to tweak input, regenerate suggestions, and save or schedule posts.
  c. Development Steps

UI/UX Design
Use Figma for wireframes and interface design, focusing on clarity and ease of use.
  Reference: Figma UI Development Documentation
Frontend Development  
  Tech stack: Vite, React, TypeScript, shadcn-ui, Tailwind CSS.
Structure app for rapid preview and hot-reloading during development.

Content Generation Logic
  Integrate with Google Gemini AI (or OpenAI) for text generation.
Modularize code for easy updates to generation logic and API providers.

Editing & Feedback
  Allow users to review and edit AI-generated content inside the app before publishing.

Deployment & Customization
  Deploy via Lovable (or your preferred platform).
Support for custom domains and easy sharing.

3. How to Run and Edit the App
    Option 1: Using Lovable
              Visit your Lovable Project and edit via the online editor.
    Option 2: Local Development
              Clone the repository:
sh
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
npm install
npm run dev
Edit with your preferred IDE.

Option 3: GitHub or Codespaces
          Edit files directly in GitHub or use Codespaces for a cloud-based IDE.

5. Deploying and Customizing
    To publish, use the “Share → Publish” feature in Lovable.
Connect a custom domain via Project > Settings > Domains.
